[Splitsy: Bill Splitting Application Proposal](/splitsy)
2020

*Abstract:* Online payment applications are very useful as people can make payments in an efficient and systematic way. In a world more and more focused on privacy we have noticed a lack of bill splitting applications privacy orientated. The purpose of the project was to plan, analyse and gather information to build a secure and user-friendly bill-splitting application. The proposal also focuses on design as well, with the use of techniques that would improve the overall system security and reliability.
