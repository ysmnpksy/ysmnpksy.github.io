## Calorie Buddy 

### Project Description 

During my second year at university, I developed a web application using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and cURL.

You can access this application [here](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/usr/343/).

The implementation for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ysmnpksy/calorieBuddy).
