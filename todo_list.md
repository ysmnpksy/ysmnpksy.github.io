## To-Do List Program 

### Project Description 

Grade: 80% 

During my second year at university, I developed a to-do list program using Java.

This program allows a user to select a list to load when opened. The user is then able to add, update and delete to-do items. When the program is closed, all changes made are saved. 

### Access Project
